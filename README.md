# Hi there, Iâ€™m Reva Mahto! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Computer Science student at UCSC, with a strong passion for building cool tech and helping communities through coding. Whether it's deploying full-stack web apps or diving into AI, Iâ€™m always looking for the next project to bring to life. I enjoy simplifying complex problems, and if Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me organizing engaging sessions for Girls Who Code or the Google Student Developer Club.

### ðŸ’» What Iâ€™m Working On:
- **UCSC GWC Website**: Building an awesome platform with React.js, Express, and MongoDB to make tech resources accessible for student minorities. 
- **AI Projects**: As part of the Google AI Studio Fellowship, Iâ€™m analyzing mental health search trends to provide valuable insights using clustering and sentiment analysis.

### ðŸ›  Tech I Use:
Python, Java, C++, React.js, Firebase, Google Cloud, and more! Always keen on learning and experimenting with new frameworks and tools.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Goals:
- Continue honing my AI and machine learning skills.
- Build meaningful projects that make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives.
- Connect with like-minded developers and learn from the community!
