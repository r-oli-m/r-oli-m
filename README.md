# Hi there, I’m Reva Mahto! 👋

🐥 I'm currently a Computer Science student at UCSC, with a strong passion for building cool tech and helping communities through coding. Whether it's deploying full-stack web apps or diving into AI, I’m always looking for the next project to bring to life. I enjoy simplifying complex problems, and if I’m not coding, you might find me organizing engaging sessions for Girls Who Code or the Google Student Developer Club.

### 💻 What I’m Working On:
- **UCSC GWC Website**: Building an awesome platform with React.js, Google Cloud, and MongoDB to make tech resources accessible for student minorities. 
- **AI Projects**: As part of the Google AI Studio Fellowship, I’m analyzing and modeling the Google Trends and U.S. CDC Flu data to provide valuable national flu prediction insights.

### 🛠 Tech I Use:
Python, Java, C++, React.js, Firebase, XCode, Google Cloud, and more! Always keen on learning and experimenting with new frameworks and tools.

### 🎯 My Goals:
- Continue honing my AI and machine learning skills.
- Build meaningful and quality projects that make a difference in people’s lives.
- Connect with like-minded developers and learn from the community!
